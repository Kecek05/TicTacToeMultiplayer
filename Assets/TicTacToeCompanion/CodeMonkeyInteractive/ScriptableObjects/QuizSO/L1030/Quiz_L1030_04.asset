  question: What should happen if there is more than one instance of the GameManager
    (singleton)?
  optionList:
  - The game continues without issues
  - The additional instance is automatically deleted
  - The singleton pattern is disabled
  - An error is logged, as only one instance should exist
  correctOptionIndex: 3
  answer: In the code we included a simple if to check if the instance already exists.
    If so then that's a mistake since there should only ever be a single GameManager
    singleton instance.
