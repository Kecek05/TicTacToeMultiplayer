  question: How do we define the singleton instance in the GameManager?
  optionList:
  - Using a public static method
  - Using a public static property with a public get and private set
  - Using a private static variable
  - Using a global variable
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: A public static property with a public get and a private set is used to
    control access to the singleton instance. This way only that class can set it
    but any other class can get it, that's exactly the level of accessibility we
    want for our singleton.
