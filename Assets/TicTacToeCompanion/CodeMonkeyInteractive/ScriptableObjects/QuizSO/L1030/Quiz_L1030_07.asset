  question: How is the singleton instance initialized in the GameManager class?
  optionList:
  - In the Awake method
  - In the Start method
  - In the Update method
  - In the OnEnable method
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: The singleton instance is set in the Awake method to ensure it is initialized
    as soon as possible. As a general rule you should initialize the current object
    on Awake and only access external references on Start.
