  question: Why is it better to use a singleton pattern instead of dragging references
    to every object?
  optionList:
  - It improves performance
  - It simplifies the codebase by avoiding the need to manually assign references
  - It enhances visual quality
  - It enables automatic synchronization
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: The singleton pattern removes the need to manually drag references to objects,
    it also avoids the potential mistake of forgeting to drag a reference and makes
    the game more code focused (instead of editor focused) which personally I prefer.
