  question: What is a static field in C#?
  optionList:
  - A field that belongs to a specific instance of a class
  - A field that belongs to the class itself and not to any specific instance
  - A field that is only accessible in the Unity Editor
  - A field used for animations
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: Static fields belong to the class itself, making them accessible without
    creating an instance of the class. Check out my C# course for the lecture on
    Static.
