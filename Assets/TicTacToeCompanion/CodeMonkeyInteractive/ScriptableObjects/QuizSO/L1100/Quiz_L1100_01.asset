  question: What is the purpose of the NetworkManagerUI?
  optionList:
  - To manage game logic
  - To provide UI buttons for starting the game as Host or Client
  - To synchronize the network objects
  - To track player scores
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: The NetworkManagerUI provides an in-game user interface with buttons for
    connecting as Host or Client, replacing the need to use inspector buttons. We
    just call StartClient(); or StartHost(); on the NetworkManager and the connection
    starts.
