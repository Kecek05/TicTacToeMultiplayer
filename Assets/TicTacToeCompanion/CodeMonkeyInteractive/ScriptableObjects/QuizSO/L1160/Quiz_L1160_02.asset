  question: What happens if scores are stored as regular int variables instead of
    NetworkVariable<int>?
  optionList:
  - Scores will be synchronized to all clients
  - Scores will only update on the server and remain 0 on clients
  - Scores will not be visible in the UI
  - Scores will reset after each game
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: Regular int variables are not synchronized, so clients will not see updated
    scores unless explicitly handled.
