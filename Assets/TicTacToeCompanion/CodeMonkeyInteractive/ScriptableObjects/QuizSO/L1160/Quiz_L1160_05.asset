  question: Why does the initial score update appear to lag behind on the client?
  optionList:
  - The network connection is too slow
  - The score update happens locally before the network variable is synchronized
  - The NetworkVariable is not initialized
  - The server has not received the player's move
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: The score update appears delayed because the network variable takes a moment
    to synchronize across the network. If you want to update something based on a
    NetworkVariable then you should make that dependent on the OnValueChanged delegate
    on the NetworkVariable.
