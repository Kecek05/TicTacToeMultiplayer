  question: How are player scores updated when a player wins?
  optionList:
  - Through a UI event listener
  - By resetting the board
  - By incrementing the respective NetworkVariable<int>.Value based on the winning
    player type
  - By using a ClientRpc
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: The NetworkVariable<int> for the winning player type is incremented on
    the server when a player wins. Since it's a NetworkVariable the new value gets
    automatically synchronized across all clients.
