  question: Why is the score update logic attached to the OnValueChanged delegate?
  optionList:
  - To ensure the score update is reflected on all clients
  - To prevent the server from overriding the client score
  - To reduce the network bandwidth usage
  - To allow manual synchronization of scores
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: Attaching the update logic to the OnValueChanged delegate ensures that
    the UI updates whenever the score changes, even across the network.
