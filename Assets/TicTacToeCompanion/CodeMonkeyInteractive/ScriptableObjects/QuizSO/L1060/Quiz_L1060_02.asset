  question: Why are certain transform properties optional for synchronization in
    NetworkTransform?
  optionList:
  - To allow better control over animations
  - To minimize bandwidth usage
  - To simplify the Unity Editor setup
  - To reduce memory usage
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: Synchronizing only the necessary data reduces bandwidth usage, which is
    crucial for multiplayer games. You don't need some data then don't waste bandwidth
    synchronizing it.
