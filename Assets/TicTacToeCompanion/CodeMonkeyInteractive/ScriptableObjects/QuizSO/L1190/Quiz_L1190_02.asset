  question: What asset did I use to add animations and effects like squash and stretch
    to objects?
  optionList:
  - Text Animator
  - All-in-One Sprite Shader
  - FEEL
  - Unity Post-Processing
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: The FEEL asset was used to add animations like squash and stretch to enhance
    the visual effects. It's an excellent asset, I highly recommend it.
