  question: What is the purpose of the TriggerOnGameTieRpc function?
  optionList:
  - To reset the game board
  - To notify all clients of a tie condition
  - To declare a winner
  - To disconnect inactive players
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: The TriggerOnGameTieRpc function notifies all clients when a tie condition
    is detected. This is necessary since the TestWinner() function is only running
    on the server.
