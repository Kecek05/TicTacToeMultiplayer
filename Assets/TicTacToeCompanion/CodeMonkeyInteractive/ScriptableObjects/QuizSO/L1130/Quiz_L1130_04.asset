  question: What issue arises when passing a Line object as an RPC parameter?
  optionList:
  - The Line object cannot be synchronized across clients
  - The Line object is not serializable by default
  - The Line object causes performance issues
  - The Line object is incompatible with Unity's UI system
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: Custom types like Line are not serializable by default, and attempting
    to pass them as RPC parameters results in an error. We need to either implement
    serialization ourselves or use a different type.
