  question: Why must the visual winning line be spawned only on the server?
  optionList:
  - To improve network performance
  - To ensure the winning line is synchronized across all clients
  - To simplify the client logic
  - To prevent the game from crashing
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: The winning line visual must be spawned only on the server to ensure it
    is synchronized correctly across all clients since only the server can spawn
    objects. Although alternatively we could spawn a local non-networked line if
    we wanted.
