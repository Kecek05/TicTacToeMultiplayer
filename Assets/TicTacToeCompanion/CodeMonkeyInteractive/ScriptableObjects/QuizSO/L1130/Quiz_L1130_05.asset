  question: What solution is implemented to pass the winning line data in the RPC?
  optionList:
  - Pass the index of the line in the predefined line list
  - Serialize the Line object manually
  - Use a global variable to store the line data
  - Convert the Line object to a string
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: Instead of sending the entire Line object, the index of the winning line
    in the predefined line list is passed to the clients. Since the list is initialized
    with the exact same data on all clients we don't need to sync any more data than
    the index.
