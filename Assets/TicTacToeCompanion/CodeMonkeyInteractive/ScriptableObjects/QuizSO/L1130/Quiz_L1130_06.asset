  question: Why is the OnGameWin event fired on both the server and client?
  optionList:
  - To synchronize the board state
  - To ensure both server and client update their UI when the game ends
  - To initialize the next game
  - To debug network connections
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: Even though the server is the one that defines where we have a win, the
    OnGameWin event is fired on both the server and client in order to update their
    respective GameOverUI elements and show the correct win/loss message.
