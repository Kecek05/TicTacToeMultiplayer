  question: Why did the client fail to update the UI when the turn changed?
  optionList:
  - The OnGameStarted event was not fired on the client
  - The arrow update logic was not synchronized to the client
  - The PlayerUI script was not attached to the canvas
  - The NetworkManager.Singleton was disconnected
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: The turn change logic was only updating on the server and not synchronized
    to the client, leading to an incorrect UI on the client.
