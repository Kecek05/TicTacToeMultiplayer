  question: Why is it important to avoid making fields public unless necessary?
  optionList:
  - It increases runtime performance
  - It simplifies multiplayer integration
  - It prevents other classes from unintentionally modifying the fields
  - It improves the visual quality of the game
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: Public fields can be accessed and modified by any class anywhere in your
    codebase, increasing the risk of unintended bugs. If you want them to be modifiable
    then make the field private and expose public get/set functions. In those you
    can then add validation to make sure the field never receives invalid values.
