  question: Why is the SerializeField attribute used for grid position coordinates?
  optionList:
  - To make the fields public
  - To keep fields private but editable in the Unity Editor
  - To enable network synchronization
  - To improve runtime performance
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: '[SerializeField] allows private fields to be edited in the Unity Editor
    while keeping them inaccessible to other classes. The most basic clean code principle
    is to minimize access as much as possible, so if a field is only meant to be
    used by one class it should be private. There''s almost no reason to make a field
    public.'
