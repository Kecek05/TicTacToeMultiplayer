  question: How is the PlayerType[,] array initialized?
  optionList:
  - In the Update method
  - In the Start method with default values
  - "During the player\u2019s turn"
  - In the Awake method as a 3x3 grid
  correctOptionIndex: 3
  answer: The array is initialized in the Awake method as a 3x3 grid, matching the
    Tic Tac Toe board. As always remember the general rule of initializing your objects
    on the Awake, and accessing external references on Start.
