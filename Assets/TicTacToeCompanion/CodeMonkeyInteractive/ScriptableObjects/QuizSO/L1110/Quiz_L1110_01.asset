  question: What is the purpose of the PlayerType[,] array?
  optionList:
  - To store the data for which object is placed on what position
  - To synchronize the game state across clients
  - To update the UI
  - To spawn objects at the correct position
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: The PlayerType[,] array tracks the state of the board, it's a two dimensional
    array for all the board grid positions. It uses the enum type so we can store
    either None or Cross or Circle on each position.
