  question: Which transport is recommended as the default for Netcode for GameObjects?
  optionList:
  - Photon Transport
  - Unity Transport
  - Steam Transport
  - Amazon AWS Transport
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: The Unity Transport is the simplest and default transport for Netcode for
    GameObjects. Although it is intentionally modular in case you want to use a different
    transport, you just need to swap it out and everything on the Netcode for Game
    Objects layer stays the same.
