  question: What Unity version is used in this tutorial?

  answer: Unity 6 which is the latest version as I'm recording this course. Even
    if you're watching this in the future I highly recommend you use the same version
    as me just to avoid any confusion. Although Netcode for Game Objects and Unity
    itself is already very robust so I'm guessing this course will still be up to
    date even many years from now.
