  question: What does the Host option in NetworkManager do?
  optionList:
  - Acts as a dedicated server
  - Acts as a client only
  - Acts as both a server and a player
  - Connects to Steam servers
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: The Host option combines the functionality of both a server and a client,
    allowing one player to act as the server while playing. That way you don't need
    dedicated servers for your games to work, one of the players will host the server
    themselves.
