  question: What is the main downside of using Unity's Relay service?
  optionList:
  - Increased file size
  - Difficulty in implementation
  - Higher ping due to the middleman server
  - Limited player count
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: Using Relay introduces a higher ping since all data must pass through the
    Relay server. Although not an issue for small scale co-op games, like what Netcode
    for Game Objects is meant for.
