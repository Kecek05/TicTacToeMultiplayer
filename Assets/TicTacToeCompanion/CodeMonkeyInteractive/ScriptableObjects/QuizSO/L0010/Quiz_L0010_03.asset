  answer: 'Multiplayer is inherently complex, so even though this is the simplest
    multiplayer game it still is not meant for absolute beginners.

    But as long
    as you have a good grasp of the basics of Unity and C# you should be able to
    follow everyting in the course. I''m always available in the course comments
    if you need extra help with anything.'
