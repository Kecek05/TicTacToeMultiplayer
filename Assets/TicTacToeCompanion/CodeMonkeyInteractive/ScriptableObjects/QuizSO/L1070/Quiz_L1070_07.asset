  question: What problem occurs when the client spawns the wrong object, and how
    is it solved?
  optionList:
  - "The RPC runs on the server but accesses the wrong data; it\u2019s solved by
    passing PlayerType as a parameter"
  - "The client uses the wrong prefab; it\u2019s solved by correcting the prefab
    reference"
  - "The network object isn\u2019t synchronized; it\u2019s solved by adding NetworkTransform"
  - "The client doesn\u2019t have permissions; it\u2019s solved by assigning server
    authority"
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: The RPC initially accesses the server's PlayerType instead of the client's.
    Passing PlayerType as a parameter solves this issue.
