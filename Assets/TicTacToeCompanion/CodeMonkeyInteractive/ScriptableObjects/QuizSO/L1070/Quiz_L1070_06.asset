  question: How does the server ensure only the current player can take a turn?
  optionList:
  - By storing a currentPlayablePlayerType and checking it before allowing actions
  - By sending RPCs to the client
  - By disabling input on the client
  - By locking the grid after every move
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: The server tracks the currentPlayablePlayerType and ensures only the player
    whose turn it is can make a move. Again, our game is server authoritative so
    the server is the ultimate source of truth.
