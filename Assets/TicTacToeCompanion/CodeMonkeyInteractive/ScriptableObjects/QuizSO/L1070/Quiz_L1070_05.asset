  question: Why is the local player type a private field with get/set functions instead
    of a public field?
  optionList:
  - To prevent accidental or unauthorized modifications
  - To reduce network latency
  - To simplify code readability
  - To enable RPC functionality
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: Again, your fields should almost always be private to prevent unintended
    modifications of that data. In this case we want other classes to be able to
    get the local player type but not set it.
