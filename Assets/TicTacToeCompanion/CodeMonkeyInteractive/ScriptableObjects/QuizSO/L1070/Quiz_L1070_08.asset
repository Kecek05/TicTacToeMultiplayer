  question: Why is the currentPlayablePlayerType field set only on the server?
  optionList:
  - To improve performance
  - To maintain server authority over game state
  - To simplify client logic
  - To prevent cheating
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: The server has authority over the game state so the server is the only
    one that matters. You could synchronize this data to the players as well but
    it would just be wasting bandwidth.
