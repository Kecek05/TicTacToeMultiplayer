  question: "What happens if a player tries to act when it\u2019s not their turn?"
  optionList:
  - The player is kicked from the game
  - The action is blocked by the server
  - The client crashes
  - The action is allowed but causes an error
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: The server checks the currentPlayablePlayerType before allowing any actions,
    if a player tries to take an action when it's not their turn it simply does nothing.
