  question: What happens to the game visuals during a rematch?
  optionList:
  - They are hidden temporarily
  - They are saved for the next round
  - They are updated with new colors
  - They are destroyed on the server

  answer: All visual game objects are destroyed on the server which in turn destroys
    them in all the clients, and they are cleared from the visualGameObjectList to
    prepare for a new game round.
