  question: Why is it important to fire the rematch event on both server and clients?
  optionList:
  - To synchronize the network variables
  - To update the player scores
  - To ensure all clients reset their game states and visuals correctly
  - To refresh the network connections
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: Firing the rematch event on both server and clients ensures all game states
    and visuals are reset. They do different things (the client just hides the GameOverUI
    element) but they must both know when a Rematch happens.
