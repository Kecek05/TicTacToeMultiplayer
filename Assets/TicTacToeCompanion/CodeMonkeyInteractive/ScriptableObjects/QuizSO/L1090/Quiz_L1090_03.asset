  question: What is the default behavior for NetworkVariable read and write permissions?
  optionList:
  - Both the server and clients can read and write
  - Only the server can write, and all clients can read
  - Only clients can write, and the server can read
  - Neither the server nor the clients can read or write
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: By default, only the server can write to a NetworkVariable, and all clients
    can read from it. This is likely the permissions setup you want to use for most
    NetworkVariables.
