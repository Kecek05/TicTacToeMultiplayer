  question: What is the purpose of the Spawn method in NetworkObject?
  optionList:
  - To instantiate the object locally
  - To synchronize the object across all clients
  - To destroy the object on the server
  - To assign ownership to a specific client
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: The Spawn method ensures that the object is synchronized across the server
    and all connected clients. When the server calls Spawn(); on an object it will
    automatically instantiate and spawn that same object on all connected clients.
