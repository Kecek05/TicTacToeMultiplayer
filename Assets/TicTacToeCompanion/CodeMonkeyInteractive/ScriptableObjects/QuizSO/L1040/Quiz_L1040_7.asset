  question: Why is it important to define a prefab as a NetworkObject?
  optionList:
  - To enable automatic animations
  - To allow the object to be synchronized across the network
  - To reduce network lag
  - To make it easier to test in the Unity Editor
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: Adding the NetworkObject component ensures the object can be spawned and
    synchronized across clients and the server. If it does not have a NetworkObject
    component (or isn't spawned) it will not exist on the network.
