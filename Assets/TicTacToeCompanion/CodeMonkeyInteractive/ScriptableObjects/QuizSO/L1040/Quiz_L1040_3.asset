  question: What is required to synchronize an object spawn across all clients?
  optionList:
  - Adding a BoxCollider2D to the object
  - Adding a NetworkObject component and calling the Spawn method on the server
  - Setting the object as a child of the GameManager
  - Using a separate event system
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: The object must have a NetworkObject component, and the server must call
    the Spawn method to synchronize it across clients. Only the server can spawn
    objects.
