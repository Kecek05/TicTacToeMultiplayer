  question: Why do I recommend using events to manage visuals?

  - To simplify the Unity Editor setup
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: Events are used to decouple the game logic from the visuals. This is a
    great clean code practice you should implement, the less coupling you have the
    easier your codebase is to manage.
