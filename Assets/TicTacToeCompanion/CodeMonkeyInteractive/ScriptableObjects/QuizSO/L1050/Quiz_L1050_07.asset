  question: What common mistake can prevent RPCs from working?
  optionList:
  - Forgetting to inherit from NetworkBehaviour
  - Forgetting to add a Rigidbody2D component
  - Forgetting to attach the script to a game object
  - Forgetting to use MonoBehaviour
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: Forgetting to inherit from NetworkBehaviour will cause RPCs to fail and
    the function will run like a normal function.
