  question: How do RPCs solve the issue of clients trying to spawn objects?
  optionList:
  - By letting clients send a message to the server, which then spawns the objects
  - By allowing clients to directly spawn objects
  - "By synchronizing the client\u2019s state with the server"
  - By disabling object spawning entirely
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: Clients cannot directly spawn objects, but they can send an RPC message
    to the server, which then handles the spawning of objects, ensuring server authority.
