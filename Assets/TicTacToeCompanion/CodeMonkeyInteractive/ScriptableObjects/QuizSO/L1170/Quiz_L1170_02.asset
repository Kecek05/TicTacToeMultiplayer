  question: How is the PlaceSfx sound effect handled in this lecture?
  optionList:
  - It is synchronized across the network
  - It is managed by the GameManager directly
  - It is added as a component to the grid
  - It is played locally without network synchronization
  correctOptionIndex: 3
  answer: "The PlaceSfx sound effect is spawned and destroyed locally since it doesn\u2019t
    require network synchronization. This helps us reduce bandwidth utilization for
    our game."
