  question: How are sound effects instantiated in the game?
  optionList:
  - By calling AudioSource.Play() directly
  - By instantiating a prefab with an AudioSource component set to Play on Awake
  - By adding them to the GameManager
  - By enabling a preloaded game object
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: Sound effects are instantiated by creating a prefab with an AudioSource
    component set to Play on Awake which will make them play as soon as they're spawned,
    and then they are destroyed a few seconds after.
