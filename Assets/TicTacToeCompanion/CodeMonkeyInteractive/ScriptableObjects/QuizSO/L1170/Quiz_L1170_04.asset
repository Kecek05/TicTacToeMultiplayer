  question: What is the advantage of playing sound effects locally instead of synchronizing
    them over the network?
  optionList:
  - It ensures all players hear the same sound at the same time
  - It prevents sound effects from being destroyed prematurely
  - It simplifies network synchronization and reduces bandwidth usage
  - It makes the sound effects louder
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: Playing sound effects locally avoids unnecessary network synchronization,
    reducing bandwidth usage and simplifying the implementation.
