  question: How are the winning lines initialized in the game?
  optionList:
  - Dynamically calculated during gameplay
  - Loaded from a file
  - Hardcoded into the TestWinner() function
  - Defined in a list during the Awake method
  correctOptionIndex: 3
  answer: All possible winning lines are predefined in a list during the Awake method
    for efficiency. Then when checking for winners we just go through that cached
    list.
