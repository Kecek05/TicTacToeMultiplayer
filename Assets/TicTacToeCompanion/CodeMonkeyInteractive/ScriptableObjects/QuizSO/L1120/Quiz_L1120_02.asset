  question: Why is a Struct used to define a Line instead of a class?
  optionList:
  - To optimize memory usage as structs are value types
  - To make the lines easier to serialize
  - To complicate the code
  - To enable network synchronization
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: A Struct is a value type, making it more memory-efficient for defining
    immutable data like a line of grid positions.
