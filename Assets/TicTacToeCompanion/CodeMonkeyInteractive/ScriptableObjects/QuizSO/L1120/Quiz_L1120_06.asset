  question: Why is an enum used for the Orientation of a line?
  optionList:
  - To simplify the rotation logic for the winning line visual
  - To use more bandwidth
  - To make the game compatible with Unity's physics system
  - To synchronize the grid state across the network
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: The Orientation enum allows for clear and easy handling of the visual rotation
    of the winning line based on its type (Horizontal, Vertical, DiagonalA and DiagonalB).
    If you ever need to define a list of possible values then you should use an enum.
