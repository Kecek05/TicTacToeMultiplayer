  title: Why is OnMouseDown used instead of IPointerDownHandler?
  text: "OnMouseDown is simpler and doesn\u2019t require setting up an event system.
    However, IPointerDownHandler is a perfectly valid alternative (as are other methods).
    Always remember how in programming and game dev every problem usually has multiple
    valid possible solutions, not just one."
