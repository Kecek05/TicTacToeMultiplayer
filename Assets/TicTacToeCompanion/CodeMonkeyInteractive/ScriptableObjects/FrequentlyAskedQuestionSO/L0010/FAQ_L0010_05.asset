  title: What if I encounter errors while following this course?
  text: 'There are various ways to get help. First, there is the Code Monkey Companion
    which includes a window that helps solve common errors and problems. Then there
    are the project files for each lecture, you can download and compare them directly
    with your own. You also have a Chat with AI window that allows you to chat with
    an AI that has been trained on the contents of the course to get instant help.
    Or you can just post a question in the lecture comments and I will answer within
    24h. So lots of ways to get help to make sure you never get stuck.
