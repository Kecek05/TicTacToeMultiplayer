  title: Why is Tic Tac Toe a good starting project for multiplayer development?
  text: 'Tic Tac Toe is a simple game design-wise which makes it great for us to
    focus on the multiplayer aspect. We can focus on just sychnronizing data and
    not complex game design which makes it a great learning project. After you learn
    to make this game you can then apply this same knowledge to more complex multiplayer
    games.
