  title: "What does \u201Csynchronizing data\u201D mean in multiplayer games?"
  text: "Synchronizing data just means sending data back and forth, ensuring that
    both players see the same game state in real-time. For example, in this course,
    the moves made by one Tic Tac Toe player are sent to the other player\u2019s
    client to keep the game consistent so both players see the same state. Multiplayer
    games are all about data, that data can represent a Tic Tac Toe move, or a Top
    Down Shooter game shooting something, or a Horror Game talking to a co-op player,
    etc.\r\n"
