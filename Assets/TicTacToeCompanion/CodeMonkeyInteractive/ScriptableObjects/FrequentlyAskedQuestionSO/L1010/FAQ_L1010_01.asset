  title: Why should I use the same Unity version as the tutorial?
  text: 'Using the same Unity version ensures that the syntax and tools match the
    tutorial, I highly recommend you use the same versions even if you''re following
    along several years in the future. Different versions might have menus in slightly
    different places which can generate confusion, although Unity 6 and Netcode for
    Game Objects are both already very robust so I''m guessing they will still be
    mostly up to date many years from now.
