  title: What is Netcode for GameObjects, and why use it?
  text: "Netcode for GameObjects is Unity\u2019s official networking solution, making
    it easy to handle multiplayer connections. It\u2019s robust, modular, and integrates
    well with Unity. Although there are many other possible networking toolstacks,
    there's Photon, Mirror, FishNet and tons more, I've heard great things about
    all of those as well (although I haven't used them)\r\n"
