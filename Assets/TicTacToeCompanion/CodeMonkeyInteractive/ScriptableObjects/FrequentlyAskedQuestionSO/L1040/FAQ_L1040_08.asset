  title: How can I use events to decouple game logic from visuals?
  text: Events allow you to fire actions in one script and handle them in another.
    Importantly, the publisher does not know and does not care if any listeners are
    listening to the event, it just invokes it. For example, the GameManager fires
    an event when a grid position is clicked, and the GameVisualManager listens to
    this event to handle visual updates.
