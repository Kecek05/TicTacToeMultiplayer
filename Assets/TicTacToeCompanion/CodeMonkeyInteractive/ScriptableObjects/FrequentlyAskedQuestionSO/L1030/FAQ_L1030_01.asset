  title: What is the Singleton Pattern, and why is it useful?
  text: 'The Singleton Pattern ensures only one instance of a class exists and provides
    a globally accessible reference to it. It is useful in game development for managing
    core systems like game managers, where there only exists a single instance of
    that object.
