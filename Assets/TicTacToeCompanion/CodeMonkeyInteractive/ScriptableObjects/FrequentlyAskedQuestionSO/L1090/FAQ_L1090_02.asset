  title: How is NetworkVariable better than using RPCs for synchronization?
  text: NetworkVariable handles data synchronization automatically, reducing the
    need to explicitly send updates through RPCs. This makes it easier to manage
    data that changes frequently, like the current turn in a turn-based game or player
    health.
