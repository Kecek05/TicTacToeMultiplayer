  title: How are visual elements like pieces and winning lines cleared during a rematch?
  text: All visual elements are stored in the visualGameObjectList, which is iterated
    through during a rematch to destroy the objects and clear the list. Since they
    are NetworkObjects then as long as the server destroys them they will also be
    destroyed on the clients.
