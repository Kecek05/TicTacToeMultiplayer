  lastChatAIQuestionAsked: What is Netcode for Game Objects?
  lastChatAIQuestionAnswer: 'Netcode for Game Objects is Unity''s own networking
    toolstack designed for small-scale co-op games. It''s the simplest networking
    option provided by Unity and is best suited for games like Tic Tac Toe, which
    you might build in the course, or other similar scale multiplayer games like
    Overcooked or Phasmophobia. This toolstack is specifically made for projects
    where you need to sync gameplay data across a network, making it easier to handle
    connections, remote procedure calls (RPCs), network variables, and more[SOURCE].
